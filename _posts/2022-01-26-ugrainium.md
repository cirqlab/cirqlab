## Problem Description

Out of a typical day, I've measured that about 2-3 hours goes toward dealing with food in some way. Time spent preparing, foraging, eating, shopping, cleaning-up afterward, or recovering from the post-lunch sleepeez. That's close to 20%, more than a day a week, of my waking life tied-up with eating. What if that time could be taken back and used for something else less mundane, like art, spending time with friends, or just relaxing to get more creative energy?

Another issues is getting the proper amount of nutrients in a day without going overboard with specific nutrition regimes. After measuring the sum of nutrition profiles for foods eaten during the day, it's obvious that getting the proper amounts of nutrients like potassium, omega-3, and insoluble fiber won't happen by accident just by choosing a variety of "healthy" foods

There are a few existing products to solve this problem, for example: Soylet and Huel. I've tried them, but found them either not very tasty, or the ingredients made too many negative nutritional compromises for the sake of marketability

## Solution Idea

Prepare a balanced, easy to use, portable food which is nutritionally complete and can be quickly consumed every two hours throughout the day. By having nutrition every two hours, the post eating sleepiness can be avoided and energy levels can stay at full power all day.

A set of base ingredients are selected and combined in the proper ratios to match individual nutrition needs.

## Steps

A set of base ingredients were selected by going through the USDA foods database and the NIH articles on nutrition for specific foods. The incgredients were also taste tested by varying the recipe every once in a while. Some of the base ingredients include flaxseed, barley, oats, lecithin (for choline), pea and whey protein.

The SciPy library includes a set of optimizers which are used to find the optimal combination of ingredients to meet my nutritional needs
